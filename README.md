Here, we provide a MATLAB code used for numerical simulations within three-component reaction-diffusion model.

************
Instructions
************
- Install the latest version of MATLAB software
- Copy "Three-component-model.m" and "Template.jpg" into the same folder
- Open "Three-component-model.m" with MATLAB software
- Adjust parameters of the simulation (simulation time, grid size, concentration of components, kinetic rate constants, etc.)
- Run the script. The figures, containing the updating concentration of free activator and/or concentrations of substrate, fast inhibitor, free activatior and free and bound activator will be shown.
- After reaching the end of simulation, the recorded video of the change in the concentration profiles of the components will be created in the folder with the MATLAB file
